### Analytics Leader | AI Consultant | Educator

I'm a data and analytics leader with over two decades of experience helping Fortune 500 companies and growing businesses harness the power of data, AI, and automation. My career spans roles at **Agilent Technologies** and **Integrated DNA Technologies**, where I've led initiatives in customer experience analytics, commercial analytics, business intelligence, and AI-driven solutions.

I'm also an Adjunct Instructor at **Kirkwood Community College**, where I teach introductory programming classes in the Cybersecurity program within the Business & IT school.

My journey includes a comeback story: from failing out of college with a 1.08 GPA to earning five advanced degrees, including being the first graduate of Drake University's Master of Data Analytics Leadership program (Student of the Year, 2020).
